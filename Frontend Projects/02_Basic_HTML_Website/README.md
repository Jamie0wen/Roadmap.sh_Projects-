Goal of this project is to teach you how to structure a website using HTML i.e. different sections of a website like header, footer, navigation, main content, sidebars etc. Do not style the website, only focus on the structure. Styling will be done in separate projects.

In this project, you are required to create a simple HTML only website with multiple pages. The website should have following pages:

Homepage

Projects

Articles

Contact

The website should have a navigation bar that should be present on all pages and link to all the pages.
